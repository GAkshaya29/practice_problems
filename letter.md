Dear Akshaya,
             
             How are you? I'm good and hope to hear same from you. How are your studies 
going on? My studies are going well. I have prepared a study timetable and studying according to it. I have scored good marks in my previous exams. I'm mainly writing this letter to tell you about how I spent my Summer Vacation.
